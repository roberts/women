# Womens Rights in Web3

This GitHub Repository contains the Whitepaper & Contracts for $WOMEN - a tokenized movement for Womens Rights in Web3.

Web3 has a Crypto Bro culture, especially on social media but also at IRL events. This is a problem as it discourages authentic women from interacting in the space.

## $WOMEN

The $WOMEN project is designed to address this problem by creating a DAO that will elect a femal Board of Directors to execute a roadmap providing a safe place and guidance for other women entering cryptocurrency during the upcoming Bull Run.
