# Womens Rights in Web3

This GitHub Repository contains the Whitepaper & Contracts for $WOMEN - a tokenized movement for Womens Rights in Web3.

## The Problem

Web3 has a Crypto Bro culture, especially on social media but also at IRL events. This is a problem as it discourages authentic women from interacting in the space.

## $WOMEN

The $WOMEN project is designed to address this problem by creating a DAO that will elect a female Board of Directors to execute a roadmap providing a safe place and guidance for other women entering cryptocurrency during the upcoming Bull Run. Fundamentally, the project will be chain agnostic with tokens (both Fungible and Non-Fungible) on every Blockchain & Layer-2 that the Board of Directors approves.

## Structure

The management structure to execute this mission is as follows:

### Token Holders

Community members holding the tokens are publicly displaying (on the Blockchain) their support for Womens Rights in Web3 & thereby contributing of both their cryptocurrency and time to this mission. The core responsibility of Token Holders is to elect the 12-person Board of Directors. Additionally, token holders should seek to promote the project & add value to the organization as much as possible. Proposals should be made by Token Holders to the Board of Directors for projects & other ideas to improve the long-term success of the organization.

### Board of Directors

The Board will be comprised of 12 women who have strong personalities on social media, understand cryptocurrency, and desire to welcome more women into Web3. They will be led by a Chairman who controls the Community Funds wallet. The Board will meet every Tuesday night for 2-3 hours and this meeting will be livestreamed on social media for full transparency. The responsibilities of the Board are to decide the direction of the organization and communicate that to the CEO along with the necessary funding to execute.

### CEO

The CEO is chosen by the Board of Directors to lead the organization. She will organize her team to execute the roadmap set forth by the Board.

### Staff and Contributors

Hired by the CEO, the staff and their contributors will execute the specific details of the roadmap.

## ERC-20 Token

As mentioned, the project will be multi-chain with tokens (both Fungible and Non-Fungible) on every Blockchain & Layer-2 that the Board of Directors approves. The core underlying asset of the project will be the $WOMEN ticker on Mainnet Ethereum and this will be the only token with DAO voting rights to elect the Board of Directors. The title of the token will be "Womens Rights in Web3" and the contract details are as follows:

### Tokenomics

There will be a fixed total supply of 69,000,420 tokens. 90% of the supply will be launched in the Uniswap V2 liquidity pool. 10% of the supply will be controlled by the Chairman of the Board to use for executing the roadmap by recruiting personnel with vested tokens.

### Tax Structure

There will be a 3/16 lopsided tax structure to encourage long-term holders and yet still allow degen traders to come in and out of the project supporting the long-term mission of the project by providing ongoing revenue to the organization to execute their roadmap. Core community members will take advantage of a low buy tax and have plenty of 0% tax off-ramps through swapping into NFTs and other project tokens allowing them to greatly benefit without the drawback of the high sales tax. The taxes will be split into 3 wallets for Marketing, Community, and Development and each will be managed independently to ensure success in those areas of execution.

## Additional Tokens

The Roadmap will include additional fungible token launches on Solana and other Blockchains to allow greater inclusivity towards women entering Web3. In addition, the roadmap includes the launches of multiple NFT projects, both those for women-centered profile pictures (PFPs) and art collections.
